# Contributing to Neural Synapse 3D

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Any questions?

If you have questions, feel free to open an issue or contact the maintainers.
